  <center><h2>About Me</h2></center>
  <p>Howdy! My name is Corbin Fanning. I am a currently a freshman business major at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M University.</a> I plan on getting my bachelor's degree in Managment Information Systems and a minor in cybersecurity. Some of the classes I take for MIS can be used for part the cybersecurity minor here at TAMU. I have created this website for my Information Systems Technology Managment class, ISTM 210.
  <p> I grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argyle,_Texas">Argyle, Texas.</a> since I was 5. My Dad is a Sales Manager for a water treatment company called <a href="https://apollowaterservices.com/">Apollo Water Services.</a> My mom is a stay-at-home mom who takes me and my sisters everywhere. I am a devoted Christian who loves the Lord and his grace. I love to read, play video games, watch movies & TV shows, hangout with friends, and watch sports. Something intresting about me is I roll around in a wheelchair and was born with a disability called Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.
